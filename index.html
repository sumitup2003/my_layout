                    Hi, I'm Sumit Upadhyay. I am a student who is pursuing B.Tech in Annamacharya College.
                    I love coding a lot! It's been 2yrs of my Engineering, and currently I am in 
                    3rd year of Engineering. It is always good to be part of something you are really 
                    fond of. It's been a good experience since i've joined the college.
                    Ever since I was young, I've been fascinated by the way things work and how we can use technology to solve problems.
                     This curiosity has shaped my journey into becoming a passionate software developer with a keen interest in exploring new technologies and methodologies.
        
                    I grew up in a small town where opportunities were limited but creativity flourished. 
                    My parents always encouraged me to explore my interests, which led me to develop a love for technology early on. 
                    I pursued this passion by studying computer science at [AITS], engaged in where I honed my skills and arious projects.
        
                    In addition to coding, I'm an avid hiker and enjoy exploring new trails on weekends. 
                    Hiking allows me to clear my mind and gain new perspectives, which I find invaluable for problem-solving. 
                    It also inspires me to integrate creative solutions into my coding projects.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am really into coding as a hobby.
                     I love the challenge of solving problems and building something from scratch.
                      Recently, I've been working on a personal project where I'm creating a webpage to discribe 
                      myself to my readers.
