            <p>
                 I (Sumit Upadhyay) am a student of B.tech 3rd year, a passionate coder with a strong background in Software Engineering.
                 My curiosity and commitments to learning have shaped me into learning of new Programming languages.
                 I'm particularly skilled in Python, SQL, Java, C, Html, css and many more, and i have a deep interest in innovating 
                 and developing things. My goal is to become a programmer. Outside of work, I enjoy painting, playing cricket, football
                 and watch movies, series or animes, which allows me to stay balanced and energized.
